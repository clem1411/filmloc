## Project presentation

We wanted to work on data about movies and more importantly which factor could influence the rating of a movie. We decided to focus on the places where the movie was shot and see if it had an impact on the rating. We would like to visualise the data in a graph (on a map) and see if there is a correlation between the rating of a movie and the place where it was shot.

### Questions we would like to answer

- Is there a correlation between the rating of a movie and the place where it was shot?
- What are the most popular places where movies are shot?
- What are the most popular places where movies are shot with the best ratings?
- What are the most popular places where movies are shot with the worst ratings?
- Are places specialising in a specific genre of movie?

## Data sources

1. We used Kaggle to retrieve our initial movie set, their ratings and other informations : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/movie-rating-dataset
2. Then we used wikidata to retrive in which city or country movies has been shot : https://query.wikidata.org/
3. Finally we wanted to get a list of every famous places and monument appearing in movies so we used grok AI to enrich our data : https://x.ai/

# Project steps

## Ingestion phase

The first dag is responsible for collecting the data. The choice that was made was to retrieve the data from kaggle then use these data for our query in wikidata and finally we use it in our prompt for Grok AI. The down half of the picture shows how the data is collected :
